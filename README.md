# LocalRide
LocalRide s a modern ride-sharing platform built to connect riders and drivers within local communities, making transportation more efficient, accessible, and sustainable. Unlike traditional ride-hailing apps that focus mainly on large cities, NeaRide is designed for neighborhoods, towns, and suburban areas where mobility options are often limited.
